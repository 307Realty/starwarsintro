          After years of galactic silence, civilization is on the brink of a new Star Wars release. Now, with the Force preparing to awaken, the people of Earth seek solace in films of old. With nowhere to turn, they gather in great numbers and watch the original trilogy without rest. Three films. 6 hours. 24 minutes. Popcorn. Slushies. Total elation.

  <p>If you don't start pulling your weight around here its going to be shape up, or…ship up. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. 

Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. 

Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. Say goodbye to THESE! I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! 

Pound is tic-tac-toe right? It walked on my pillow! How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Am I in two thirds of a hospital room? Happy Franklin Friday. Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans. 

She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. 

It walked on my pillow! I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. 

What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?  Hahahahah! Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. 

I should be in this Poof. They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. 

I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar.
